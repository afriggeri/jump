#Installation

    npm -g install jump
    jump >> ~/.bash_profile  # or ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.bash_profile

#Usage

Pretty simple, `jump` is aliased to `j` :

    j

Type a few letters, `jump` autosuggests 5 results, move with arrows, return to select.

`jump` also supports a few options:

    jump [options]

      Options:

        -h, --help       output usage information
        -v, --version    output the version number
        -n --number <n>  number of suggestions
        -a --auto        automatically change directory if only one suggestion
    

`jump` uses spotlight (`mdfind`) behind the scenes, probably won't work on anything but osx.

#Service

A service is included so that it is possible to bind a keyboard shortcut to starting jump (e.g. `^T`).

#TODO

Sort by usage would be nice.
